This is a code quiz that demonstrates the understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts.

It consists of an .html file (index.html), CSS file (style.css) and a Javascript file (script.js) that will allow the user to complete a timed quiz.  The user cannot advance until the correct answer is achieved.  For every incorrect answer, ten seconds are deducted.  Once the timer hits 0 seconds, the game is over.
